  "intro": "I'm an experience-focused developer who works closely with companies and individuals to build strategies and impactful digital products for their brands.\n\nFull time, I lead tech efforts at [Upstatement](https://upstatement.com/), a digital product studio. I live in Portland, Oregon because the skiing is better out here. Sometimes I make my own beer and it usually comes out alright. I also have a tendency to yell at Boston sports teams.\n"
