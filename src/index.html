  <p>I'm an experience-focused developer who works closely with companies and individuals to build strategies and
    impactful digital products for their brands.</p>
  <p>Full time, I lead technology at [Upstatement](https://upstatement.com/), a digital product studio.</p>
  <p>Sometimes I make my own beer and it usually comes out alright. I also have a tendency to yell at Boston sports
    teams.</p>
