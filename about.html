      <h1>Hey. I'm Nick</h1>
      <p> I'm a student at Northeastern University in Boston, currently in my middler (3rd) year. If you read the intro on the home page, you already know that I don't really have a specific area that I'm focusing on in regard to creative media. But, if you're looking for something solid, I'm officially studying to get a dual B.A. in Graphic Design and Interactive Media.</p>
      <p>I grew up in Somers, a small town in rural Connecticut. And by small I mean I graduated high school with only 120 other kids. Looking back, I loved the whole small town thing: knowing everyone in town, playing pickup hockey in the streets, and of course, the agricultural fair that everyone hated but went to anyway because it was the cool thing to do. But when it came time for college, I thought I would enjoy a larger and more active environment. I was right.</p>
      <p>Northeastern and Boston have always been the best decision I could have ever made. I've truly found that a big area means big opportunity. I am a diehard Boston sports fan, and love watching and participating in sports, something I've continued to do in college. I am currently a member of the Northeastern Club baseball team (we won the 2010 National Championship), and I've participated in four seasons of intramural sports, including soccer, volleyball, and broomball. In addition, I have a sports radio show on the campus radio station, the SportsCorner with Braica and Horner.</p>
      <p>Of course, beyond all this recreation I have found time to so some work. Having little to no experience in many of the things I currently work with before I came to Northeastern, the expanse of knowledge, concepts, and applications that I was unfamiliar with is astounding, considering all of my interests. However, since my freshman year of college I have learned and utilized HTML, CSS, and PHP coding in published sites, and have been employed by three different companies to assist them with creating web based media, in addition to a few freelance side projects. I have learned the basics of ActionScript 3 and developed a large interactive Flash site that is both funny and interesting. I am proficient in all of Adobe's Creative Suite programs, and know how to use them all to create one solid piece of work. I'm also pretty good at mowing greens on a golf course (just ask Twin Hills Country Club). Just imagine what I can do in the next couple years.</p>
      <p>Call me a nerd, but the truth is, I work hard and learn quickly. If I'm interested in something, I'll immerse myself in it until I'm terrific at it. And for me, one of the most interesting things you can do is create something that other people will enjoy.</p>
