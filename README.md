braican.com
===========

I like to build websites.

This is the public repository of [braican.com](http://braican.com), [Nick Braica's](http://twitter.com/braican) portfolio site.

Each iteration of braican.com was pretty much a ground-up build. In other words, there was no code sharing between one version and another. Despite this, I've still decided to keep all development (i.e. versions 2, 3, 4, future development, etc.) in the same repo. If there's a good reason for not doing this, I hope someone will tell me. Otherwise, I'm gonna keep doing what I'm doing because I like the idea of having everything in one place.

## version 5
`released 01/06/2018`

Started Friday, December 8, 2017. Simple site with goofy intro and a list of projects.

## version 4
`released 03/19/2014`

A custom, one page WordPress theme that consists of sections for my work, about me, and contact links. The theme is responsive, and it does some sweet ajax magic to bring in the portfolio items.

## version 3
`released 09/30/2011`

Created using HTML/CSS/JavaScript, with WordPress being the back end of the blogging funtionality. The theme consisted of large banners across each page with a fixed, full-screen image. This site is not responsive.

## version 2
`released 10/20/2010`

Way back machine.
