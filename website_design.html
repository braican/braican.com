      <h1>I like to make websites</h1>
      <p>I always was somewhat intrigued by the internet, especially when I was younger and had absolutely no idea how it worked. So when I took a required Interactive Tools class at Northeastern which taught me the basics of HTML and CSS, I was pretty much hooked. From there, I took an interest in the workings of web development, and have since tried to teach myself as much as possible about all aspects of the internet and its applications.</p>
      <p>The fact is, web development combines the two things I was looking to combine when I came to school: technology and creativity. And that is something I can really get into.</p>

        <div class="highslide-caption"> Caption for the first image. This caption can be styled using CSS. </div>

      </div>You're already here. This is my personal site, home of my portfolio, contact information, blog, and everything else that proves to you that I'm good at what I do. My aim was for a simple site, and I believe I accomplished this with the top (and side) navigation, along with the simplistic layout. I also utilize WordPress and its PHP applications for the blog, along with Highslide JS for viewing the images and PDF's. What you're seeing here is currently version 2.0</p>

The website uses HTML and CSS, along with SortTable JS used to sort the statistics. This site was my first complete website design. I am currently in charge of updating and maintaining the site as the season goes on. </p>

      <h1>NextGen Realty</h1>
      <p>In addition to personal and freelance web design, I also worked as in intern at <a href="http://www.nextgenrealty.com/" target="_blank">NextGen Realty</a>, located in Allston, MA, during the Spring 2010 semester. During my time at NextGen, I helped with developing and improving the 80+ websites under the company's control. Specifically, I was tasked with creating and modifying content, adjusting and producing graphic elements, and working with PHP to integrate privacy policies, among other things. Two new sites were launched during my time there; BackBayPads.com and BostonRealEstateJob.com.</p>
      <div class="left">
        <h3 class="h3title"><a href="http://www.backbaypads.com" target="_blank">BackBayPads.com</a></h3>
        <a href="http://www.backbaypads.com" target="_blank" class="picture"><img src="assets/work/backbaypads_site.jpg" /></a>
        <p>BackBayPads was an existing site that simply needed to be redone. The current site was built completely from the ground up, and assists users with finding apartments and real estate in the Boston area, especially the Back Bay.</p>

        <h3 class="h3title"><a href="http://www.bostonrealestatejob.com" target="_blank">BostonRealEstateJob.com</a></h3>
        <a href="http://www.bostonrealestatejob.com" target="_blank" class="picture"><img src="assets/work/realestatejobs_site.jpg" /></a>
        <p>BostonRealEstateJob.com was a brand new site aimed at promoting the company as a potential place of employment. The site included links to Real Estate schools in the area, information on licensing, and other various information on the company and their services.</p>
